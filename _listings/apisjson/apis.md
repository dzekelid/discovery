description: APIs are becoming a crucial part of the Web. Unfortunately however, it
  remains very difficult to determine the location of these APIs on servers around
  the Web. The only way to discover APIs and their properties is via human driven
  search through public search engines or in hand curated API Directory listings.
  While these methods work, neither can scale to the potentially hundreds of thousands
  and millions of APIs which will be published over the next few years.
